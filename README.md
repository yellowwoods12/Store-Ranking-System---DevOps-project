# Store-Ranking-System-DevOps-project
This project was worked upon as part of the DevOps semester project.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The system is to rank the Access Point Stores based on factors like Distance from the Customers, Store availability, Throughput, New Launch, etc. to provide the closest and most reliable store at the top to the customer as well as distributing the order traffic at the same time.

The whole system will consist of 2 portals. The first one to onboard the stores through the portal and another one to search the stores. Searching will return the numerous stores ranked by the Ranking system in the backend. The Ranking system will rank the stores by keeping the weightage to the factors and calculate a normalized score to rank the locations.
